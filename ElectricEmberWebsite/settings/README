# base.py - Project settings common to all all environments
# local.py - Shared Dev/Debug settings
# production.py - Settings for full production environment (shouldn't deviate much from base.py)

# Potential Future additions
# staging.py - Settings for staging on prod server
# devDEV_NAME.py - Individual developer settings for DEV_NAME
# test.py - settings for running tests
to run the server using a particular settings file use the --settings option like so:
  ./manage.py runserver --settings=ElectricEmberWebsite.settings.local
